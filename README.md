# cs61a_2011

This is my attempt to complete the course 'CS61A' taught at Berkeley. This instance of the course was in the Spring 2011.

* The book they use for this course is, 'Structure And Implementation Of Computer Programs' (better known as SICP). Below are links to the book and other resources.
